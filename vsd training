Inception of open source EDA, OpenLANE & Sky130 PDK:
How to talk to computers

Introduction to QFN-48 Package,chip,pads,core,die & IP's

The most popular board in markets is ARDUINO boards. Usually it contains IC, power pins, Analog pins, digital signal inputs &
interface.
![arduino!] (arduino.png)
Typical Arduino board consists of Processor or IC which interacts with JTAG-UART FTDI, QSPI1-Flash, I2C0-EEPROM, VDD/GND,
ADC (QSPI3), muxed with GPIO's, SDRAM

QFN-48 Package & Quad Flat no leads
There are two types of chips which are wire bound & flip chip. In this swe are focussing on wire bound chip where IC 
connects with inteface using wires.
The components of the chip are PADS,CORE area,DIE area.
In core area we have RISCV Soc, GPIO Bank, SRAM, ADC, DAC, SPI
<Foundry Ip Image>
Foundary is a place where chip manufacturing takes place. Examples of foundary are TSMC,GF,UMC,SAMSUNG

Introduction to RISC-V (Instruction Set Architecture)


If C language is out to run on particular layout (interior chip), it has to compile in assembly language and then needs to compile into machine level language 
(Hexa decimal format).
HDL (Hardware descriptive language). It will have exact RISCV architecture defined specifications. Example considered here is picorv32 cpu core.


From Software Applications to hardware

Various components of system software are OS,COMPILER,ASSEMBLER.

SOC DESIGN USING OPEN LANE
Few open source EDA Tools are
CloudV (cloud based verilog IDE/Simulator)
Fault (DFT toolchan)
SocGen (SoC generation from architectural desc)
AISC needs RTL IP's, EDA Tools & PDK DATA (process design kits). Few important websites are 
librecores.org
opencores.org
github.com
Few important EDA tools are Qflow, open road, open lane, spice simulator,sis,magic.
Collection of files used to model a fabrication process for the EDA tools used to design an IC
process Design Rules: DRC,LVS,PEX
Device Models, Digital standard cell libraries, IO libraries
FOSS 130nm production PDK: github.com/google/skywater-pdk

Simplified RTL to GDSII FLOW
Synthesis, floorplan, placement, clock tree synthesis, routing, signoff
Synthesis: Converts RTL to a circuit out of components from the std cell library.
Chip floorplanning: Partition the chip die between different system building blocks and place the I/O pads.
Macro Floor Planning: Dimensions,pin locations,rows definition.
Power planning
Place the cells on the floorplan rows, aligned with the sites which usually happens in 2 steps, Global & Detailed.
Clock tree synthesis: Create a clock distribution network.
To deliver the clock to all sequential elements (eg : FF)
With minimum skew (Zero is hard to achieve)
And un a good shape. Usually H Tree, X Tree.
Routing: Implement the interconnect using the available metal layers.
