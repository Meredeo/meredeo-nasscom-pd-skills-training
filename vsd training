Day 1:
Inception of open source EDA, OpenLANE & Sky130 PDK
The most popular board in markets is ARDUINO boards. Usually it contains IC, power pins, Analog pins, digital signal inputs &
interface.

Typical Arduino board consists of Processor or IC which interacts with JTAG-UART FTDI, QSPI1-Flash, I2C0-EEPROM, VDD/GND,
ADC (QSPI3), muxed with GPIO's, SDRAM

QFN-48 Package & Quad Flat no leads
There are two types of chips which are wire bound & flip chip. In this swe are focussing on wire bound chip where IC 
connects with inteface using wires.
The components of the chip are PADS,CORE area,DIE area.
In core area we have RISCV Soc, GPIO Bank, SRAM, ADC, DAC, SPI

Foundary is a place where chip manufacturing takes place. Examples of foundary are TSMC,GF,UMC,SAMSUNG
